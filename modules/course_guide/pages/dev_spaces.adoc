= Use Devspace (skip if using local system)

Every Open Training course is developed in public GitHub repositories.
In order to make development as easy as possible, we provide you with the option of using a Dev Spaces instance.
If you're not familiar with this, just think of it as your normal IDE (VSCode in this case) running in the cloud.
It has everything you should need to write asciidoc, render into a preview, and interact with GitHub to push and pull.

== Set up or Access Dev Spaces Instance

. After the GitHub repository is created for the course, you will see a `Developer Workspace` button in the README section of the repository.
+
Click this button to launch the Dev Spaces instance.

. When prompted, select the `Log in with OpenShift` button and use the credentials that you were provided.
+
This is usually your Red Hat SSO credential.

. Once you have successfully logged in, select the option to `Open the existing workspace` or `Switch to running workspace` if prompted.
+
Ignore this step if not prompted for this option.

. When the VSCode interface loads, click `Yes, I trust the authors`.

NOTE: Why do I trust them?

That is it!
You are ready to start writing your content.
The file and folder structure is already in place, so you just need to start filling in blanks and deleting files that you won't need.

== Render content draft

NOTE: Make your training content repository is initialized and the changes are committed by the training team before using it in the devspace.

. Load your content repository in the devspace environment using the steps mentioned in FIXME
. Click on the search bar for Workspace on top and click on Run Task option, then click devfile.

+
. Click on `0-install` option and wait for it to finish.
. Repeat the earlier step to select devfile and click on `1-watch` option this time.
. Repeat the same steps and select `2-serve` option now.
. Pop-up will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.

. Create `Open In New Tab` button.

. On the next pop-up message: `Do you want VS Code - Open Source to open the external website?` click on `Open` button.

. Rendered content will now be displayed in another tab.

. You may continue with your content development in the `vscode` interface provided by devspace.

. When you save your changes in the content files in devspace interface, the changes will be reflected in the rendered content url as soon as you refresh the url.
